# Asthma_Clustering
R scripts aimed at understanding asthma heterogeneity and complexity using unsupervised, semi-supervised and supervised clustering methods in order to: 

 1) Identify asthma phenotypes that differ depending on a combination of demographic, biological, physiological, pathological, environmental and genetic factors. 

 2) Analyze the association between asthma phenotypes and asthma severity levels defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines (GINA).
